### üöÄ **Features**
- **Blueprint Scanning**: Seamlessly capture physical blueprints using AR technology.
- **3D Model Generation**: Convert scanned blueprints into digital 3D models with precision.
- **Interactive Visualization**: View and manipulate models in an immersive AR environment using Apple Vision Pro.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share digital blueprints with team members and make real-time annotations.
- **Smart Insights**: Get automated structural analysis and insights to optimize designs.

---

### üí° **Technology Stack**
- **Hardware**: Apple Vision Pro
- **Programming Language**: Swift
- **Frameworks & APIs**:
  - **ARKit**: For augmented reality integration.
  - **VisionKit**: To process and extract details from blueprints.
  - **CoreML**: For AI-driven analysis and 3D model generation.
  - **RealityKit**: For rendering 3D models in AR.
